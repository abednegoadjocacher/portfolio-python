I have dedicate this project to learning and building real world projects.

First project checks for website url validation
users are permitted to provide the url of the website.
I used string functions like lower() to convert user input into lowercase.
I checked the for the beginning of the user input using the string function startswith()
Also compared the end of the user input url to my database to find specific TLDs. 

Second project is Step counter.
user enter their daily step walk goal.
user enter the current step walked
I calculate the remaining step to check if user achieved their goal or not.


Third project is text formatter
The project accepts user input.
Change the format of the data accepted from the user to suits the user choice.
I handle if user error when option is selected

Project four is a word scrambler more like it shuffles the word being provided with.
The project accept user input and runs until user Quite it by pressing "q"

project five is a calculator. Unfortunately I want  my calculator to be more responsive to user input.
I have some bugs to fix to make it more efficient.
On 28th May, 2025 the bugs are all fixed. The calculator accept user input and check for valid input before performing an action.

Project six is task manager. I called it task manage but people would prefer to call it to do list. I have just implemented one face of it where you can add tasks to you list. I have complete the project.
I did implemented the remove task, view task and end operation.
