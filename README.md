I have dedicate this project to learning and building real world projects.

First project checks for website url validation
users are permitted to provide the url of the website.
I used string functions like lower() to convert user input into lowercase.
I checked the for the beginning of the user input using the string function startswith()
Also compared the end of the user input url to my database to find specific TLDs.
