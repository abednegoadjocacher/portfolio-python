I have dedicate this project to learning and building real world projects.

First project checks for website url validation
users are permitted to provide the url of the website.
I used string functions like lower() to convert user input into lowercase.
I checked the for the beginning of the user input using the string function startswith()
Also compared the end of the user input url to my database to find specific TLDs. 

Second project is Step counter.
user enter their daily step walk goal.
user enter the current step walked
I calculate the remaining step to check if user achieved their goal or not.


Third project is text formatter
The project accepts user input.
Change the format of the data accepted from the user to suits the user choice.
I handle if user error when option is selected
